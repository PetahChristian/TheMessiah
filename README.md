## Quoted scripture
Quoted scripture meets each publisher's fair use guidelines, and is properly cited as required.

## Custom fonts
The TeX Gyre Heros font family — a close alternative to Helvetica — provides the necessary small-caps variant to properly render <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.

As the TeX Gyre Heros OpenType fonts did not appear to encode their specific style and weight traits, I re-encoded them with the [Glyphs font editor](http://www.glyphsapp.com).  This enabled switching between the Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic custom fonts via `[UIFont fontWithDescriptor:...]`, and also cleared up a font metrics issue affecting the baseline position and lineHeight.

*The original fonts can be found at [GUST](http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/heros/index.html).*

## Designed for iOS 8
* Uses Universal storyboard
* Supports iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
